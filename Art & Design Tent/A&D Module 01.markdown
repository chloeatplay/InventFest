# Art and Design Module 1: Rep Your Hometown

Welcome to the art + design tent for InventFest. If you are here, you probably want to learn how to connect 3-D printing and littleBits, design funky products that whirrr-and-buzzz and fashion installations that make people go "wow."

We'll start this weekly Invent with a challenge to create a "bitified" sign for your hometown or city. 

# Design Constraints
1. Your sign should have at least one LED/lighted part and one moving part. 
2. The sign should tell the story of your town in your own way.
3. Make a short video of your sign in both "on" and "off" mode and say a little bit about how it describes you.
