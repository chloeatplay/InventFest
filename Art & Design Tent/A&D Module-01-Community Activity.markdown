## Community Activity: "Make a City"
1. At your event, have everyone design and construct a building with a robust sign at the top (they can follow the directions in the Weekly Invent). 
2. Individuals can look to littleBits projects for ideas to get them started:
 - [Bitify Lego Tower Bridge](http://littlebits.cc/projects/bitify-lego-tower-bridge)

3. Collaboratively, ask participants to put their city together. Which buildings should go where? Why? Take a photo of the collective city and post the project below.
