## Community Activity: "The Reflecting Pool"
1. At your event, ask individuals to create their own DIY Quantified Self Projects.
2. In pairs, ask participants to "test drive" each other's devices. Before the test drive begins, ask participants to guess at the resulting data.
3. In a collaborative conversation, discuss whether the actual data compares to what participants guessed or projected.
