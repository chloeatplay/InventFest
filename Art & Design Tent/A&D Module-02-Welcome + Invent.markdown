# Art and Design Module 2: DIY Quantified Self

Sensors allow us to track temperatures, increases in pressure, changes in sound. How can we use this data to inform our life decisions? How can we look at our behavior at a high level and see trends, ideas, habits we'd like to change?

This week's "Invent" prompt will ask you to mashup a littleBits sensory input bit + human behavior. 

# Design Constraints
1. Your project should use a sensor to measure some aspect of human behavior: movement, pressure, tempature, etc.  
2. A user should be able to wear the project, or carry it with them easily.
3. The output of the sensory information is up to you: it can be a piece of art, a note in a song, or a step in a motor. T

# Inspiration, Examples and Support

### [Drawing Bots, Generative Art Machines](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/drawing-bots-generative-art-machines)
Purpose: This workshop asks participants to use littleBits to 
create machines that can create drawings and paintings independently. 
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the 
use of an autonomous system. In discussing generative art and its principles, 
participants are challenged to invent their own drawing bots.

>Whatâ€™s your dream bit? the Neural Network bit; imagine all the possibilities, solutions, and applications for this bit.

>BREAKING NEWS: Danielle Delgado is awesome :)

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss the weekly resource for Module 2 for Art and Design
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Community Activity for Module 2 for Art and Design
