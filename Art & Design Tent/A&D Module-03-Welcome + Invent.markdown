# Design Constraints
1. Your sign should have at least one LED/lighted part and one moving part. 
2. The sign should tell the story of your town in your own way.
3. Make a short video of your sign in both "on" and "off" mode and say a little bit about how it describes you.

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

### [Prismo](http://littlebits.cc/projects/prismo)

>Its goal was etablished by a simple observation : at work, more your responsabilities are importants, and less you are available for your colleagues. Except them, your family can try to join you when you’re busy.

>Prismo will allow your family or your colleagues to know in real time if it’s a good time to contact you or not, by a simple light signal. If the indicator is on, you show that you’re busy. If it’s not the case, you show that you’re available.

>Synchronised with Google Calendar, Prismo will automaticaly activate itself according to your meetings planification.
