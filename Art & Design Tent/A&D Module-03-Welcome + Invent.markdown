# Art and Design Module 3: Safety First Challenge

This week we're asking you, BitSTARs, to use littleBits to make the world a safer (and more bitified!) place. For your Weekly Invent, ask yourself the following questions:

- What tools can we design to prevent accidents? 
- What sensory data can we use to make us safer and happier?
- Can we create a product that is less pointy/sharp/noisy/slipper than what we have now?

# Design Constraints
1. Your product should use a sensory input and a [parallel circuit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/series-and-parallel-circuits).
2. Describe the inspiration for the project and the problem you are trying to solve.
3. Give your product a snappy, ["As Seen on TV"](http://www.asseenontv.com/) product name. 

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

### The Mind-Reader Helmet

>MindRider, the brain-reading bike helmet system, generates new kinds of health data and health sense-making at the individual and regional scale. Every MindRider helmet employs a distinctive combination of two head-based wearable technologies, the bike helmet and the EEG (electroencephalography) sensor, giving users new insight into their mental experiences as they ride.


### [Prismo](http://littlebits.cc/projects/prismo)

>Its goal was etablished by a simple observation : at work, more your responsabilities are importants, and less you are available for your colleagues. Except them, your family can try to join you when you’re busy.

>Prismo will allow your family or your colleagues to know in real time if it’s a good time to contact you or not, by a simple light signal. If the indicator is on, you show that you’re busy. If it’s not the case, you show that you’re available.

>Synchronised with Google Calendar, Prismo will automaticaly activate itself according to your meetings planification.

## Your Fellow BitStars
### Paige Russell
>Paige Russell @paigeandmodern is an artist working at the Instructables Design Studio. She is also the maker of the Scent-imental Notification System which involves the nose in this whole tech revolution by releasing an assigned scent whenever you’re tagged on Instagram. We had the pleasure of talking to Paige an learning a little bit more about her practice and inspiration.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss Module 3 for Art and Design
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Community Activity for Module 3 of Art and Design
