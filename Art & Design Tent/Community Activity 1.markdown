## Community Activity: "Make A Pop-Up Art Exhibition"
1. At your event, have everyone work on a piece inspired by an artist of their choice. 
2. Here are some littleBits art projects to get inspiration from:
- Sound Box by MJ (link TBD)
- Interactive LED display (link TBD)
- Smart Art http://littlebits.cc/projects/smart-art
* not sure if relevant;
- UnderCover Art http://littlebits.cc/projects/undercover-art
- Wearable Hedhehog http://littlebits.cc/projects/cardboard-hedgehog
3. Collaboratively, ask participants to put their show together. Which pieces should go where? Why? Take a photo of the different art pieces and the show, upload on MakerHub and post the project link below.
