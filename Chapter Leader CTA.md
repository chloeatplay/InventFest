# Invent Anything BitStar Community

## Greetings BitSTARs,

Chloe and Vanessa here, your hostesses for InventFest. We're so glad you're here :)

Have you ever wondered what's the best way to teach circuits? Or design learning activities for your events? How do you build a local following or community? Or maybe you are stumpted and just want to meet other people who run littleBits groups around the world?

InventFest will "officially" open for signup on *February 15* but we're reaching out early because we want to codesign our Festival with you. Together we will build, test and reflect upon activites + tools to grow community around littleBits. 

What will that look like? How will we bring together our awesome forces? Read on!

## Names, Dates, Times

On January 6th you'll receive an email that from us hostesses at InventFest beta. During each week of the beta test, we'll work on activities and then share during our weekly "FestUps" over [UnHangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/littleBits). 

Please put these dates and times in your calendar now. We will send a follow-up dinner-party-invitation (though it will proabably look like a calendar invite!)

- 7:00 EST Tuesday January 6 2015: Welcome and How this Works
- 7:00 EST Tuesday January 13 2015: How to Design a Learning Activity
- 7:00 EST Tuesday January 20 2015: Building Your Community and Finding Your Crew
- 7:00 EST Tuesday January 27 2015: How to Host an Event
- 7:00 EST Tuesday February 3 2015: Exhibiting Work, Empowering Peers 

We'll start each FestUp with an activity to help you craft awesome experiences for your local audience, share resources and build buzz around your events. It's going to be totally stellar.  

## Get Started

1. Reply to Chloe: "Yes I'm in!" (We're going pretty low-tech with the signup until the landing page gets launched). 
2. Make sure you have a littleBits [makerhub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) account to show off your nifty projects.
3. Register for [Unhangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/littleBits). We'll hold our weekly meetups virtually on this platform. 
4. **Bookmark** and register for [Discourse](http://discuss.littlebits.cc/). This will be our main communication "hub."

**High Fives!!** The BitSTAR team
