# Synth Module Week 1: BYO Instrument
If you are here, you likely have tinkered with the [Synth Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/synth-kit) before. We'll be using bits from the Synth Kit throughout this tent, so you may want to snag those online or [swing by Radioshack](http://www.radioshack.com/littlebits?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=RSO_SRC_EN_NCA_TM_E_Manufacturer&CID=ip:SEM:RSO:Google:radio-shack_little_bits&gclid=COuhiJCTwcICFajm7AodCVYApQ&gclsrc=aw.ds). 

To get us started, we’ll be playing with a song you already love. What's a tune you played over and over as a teenager?? Tom Petty, the Eagles or Pat Benetar are *not* embarrassing. Do a Google search for the track online. Choose particular sound in the song--we’re going to make an instrument for it. 

## Design Constraints
1. Instrument must reflect a unique sound from a song of your youth.
2. It must play more than 3 notes.
3. Take a video of you playing the instrument that lasts more than 30 seconds.

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

>Which product did you use and what made you decide to choose this?

>The Synth Kit has allowed us to get users to experiment with sound making in a very personal way. In the film  we’ve just made (below), we were in a workshop for users to create creature sounds. The Synth Kit was ideal for this and gave us a way for users to not only create sounds but to use the kit to physically make their sounds and understand how the different modules worked together. The product is great because it helps you find weird organic sounds through experimentation.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Readings on Music Education / Music Creation
2. Group Activity
3. Re/hack: Hack this Module
