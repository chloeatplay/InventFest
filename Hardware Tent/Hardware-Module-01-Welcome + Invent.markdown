The "Future of Accessible Cities" is a window display at Adaptive Design Association store front window located in New York City 313 W. 36th Street. People passing by can interact with a "flying" wheelchair via SMS. The future city is made of cardboard, littlebits, arduino and a motor. We want to encourage creative thinking about the future of accessibility in cities and society.
