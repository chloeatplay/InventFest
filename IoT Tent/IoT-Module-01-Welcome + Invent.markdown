# IoT Module Week 1: If these Walls Could Talk!
Welcome to the Internet of Things tent for InventFest! If you are here, you probably have poked around with the [Smart Home Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/smart-home-kit), or at least have a [Cloudbit](http://littlebits.cc/bits/cloudbit) that will allow you to "snap the internet to anything." 

This first Weekly Invent will challenge you to use the kit to Hack your house. We'll provide some design constraints, a few example projects to get you started, and then you'll be on your way. 

# Design Constraints
1. Consider your house from the point-of-view of your pet or an inanimate object. Is your cat bored? Is your Roomba sad? 
2. Create a project that improves the livelihood of that pet/thing **and** upcycles something in your house. (Think old wallets, floppy disks, plastic bottles, [a plastic bottle](http://littlebits.cc/projects/littlepiggy-bank--3)--have at it!)

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Readings on Music Education / Music Creation
2. Group Activity
3. Re/hack: Hack this Module
