# IoT Module Week 1: If these Walls Could Talk!
Welcome to the Internet of Things tent for InventFest! If you are here, you probably have poked around with the [Smart Home Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/smart-home-kit), or at least have a [Cloudbit](http://littlebits.cc/bits/cloudbit) that will allow you to "snap the internet to anything." 

This first Weekly Invent will challenge you to use the kit to hack your house. We'll provide some design constraints, a few example projects to get you started, and then you'll be on your way. 

# Design Constraints
1. Consider your house from the point-of-view of your pet or an inanimate object. Is your cat bored? Is your Roomba sad? 
2. Create a project that improves the livelihood of that pet/thing **and** upcycles something in your house. (Think old wallets, floppy disks, plastic bottles, [a plastic bottle](http://littlebits.cc/projects/littlepiggy-bank--3)--have at it!)

### Make Your Bits Talk to Other Things
IFFT (a service that stands for "if this, then that") offers recipes that combine your Cloudbit, an object and you.

### Friday’s Tips and Tricks: What household item enhances any lighting project?

German playwright Bertolt Brecht said that the essence of art is to see things differently, even in your daily life. Through the eye of an artist, any common item in your house can be a source of inspiration for your project. Let’s find out which household items can help you enhance your light based projects.

### Bristle Bot

In this littleBits project you attach a vibration motor to the head of a tooth brush to create your own robot! By adjusting the dimmer, you can control the movement of the little bot making him travel slowly and smoothly or quickly and in every direction!
