# Synth Module Week 1: Tinkering with Logic
Welcome eduatorly folks. If you are here, you likely work with younger Bit'sters in classrooms, libraries and makerspaces. These modules will help you plan face-to-face STEAM activities, get support from the littleBits team, and connect to other educators over the interwebs. It's gonna be stellar. 

For your first weekly Invent, we'll be playing with gates and making things go. You'll likely need bits from the [Logic Expansion Pack](http://littlebits.cc/expansion-packs/logic) and you may want to scope out the [Space Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/space-kit) as well. 

As educators ourselves, we believe in tinkering and remixing as core learning methods, and we're going to model those with you. To wit, we'll be copying complex circuits other people make, and then hacking them to meet our needs. 

## Design Constraints
1. Select a complex circuit from the inspiration and examples below: we've provided musical, artistic and goofy examples for you to riff on.  
2. Remove and/or replace two module bits from the circuit. 
3. Make a short video of you explaining what you changed and what the circuit does now that it didn't before.

## Your Fellow BitStars

>My most recent teaching experience with littleBits came as part of a large 4-H program on campus at Cornell University. For the past twelve years I’ve worked with 4-H youth on a variety of technology centered projects – from prototyping mobile devices to digital storytelling. This year, my focus shifted to a more maker oriented program. Kids are swimming in technology, but it is mostly a black box. I wanted to do something that opened that box, at least a little bit.

>littleBits came to mind immediately as I began the process of planning for this session. I wanted to provide a range of activities of varying technical skill levels, in order to accommodate a mix of technical facility in my participants.

>One of the ground level learnings I wanted to facilitate was a basic understanding of how components fit together to create something. This may seem a bit facile but over the years, and over a range of topics, I have found that kids can work quite well with technology without more than a surface acquaintance of what makes things go zoom. littleBits provide a fun and easy way for kids with no prior experience or understanding of circuits to grab a  handful, sit down with minimal guidance and begin connecting things to see what happens.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Discuss Module 1 for STEAM
2. Group Activity Meetup
3. Re/hack: Hack Module 1
