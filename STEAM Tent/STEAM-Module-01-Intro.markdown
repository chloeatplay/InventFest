# Synth Module Week 1: Tinkering with Logic
Welcome eduatorly folks. If you are here, you likely work with younger Bit'sters in classrooms, libraries and makerspaces. These modules will help you plan face-to-face STEAM activities, get support from the littleBits team, and connect to other educators over the interwebs. It's gonna be stellar. 

For your first weekly Invent, we'll be playing with gates and making things go. You'll likely need bits from the [Logic Expansion Pack](http://littlebits.cc/expansion-packs/logic) and you may want to scope out the [Space Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/space-kit) as well. 

As educators ourselves, we believe in tinkering and remixing as core learning methods, and we're going to model those with you. To wit, we'll be copying complex circuits other people make, and then hacking them to meet our needs. 

## Design Constraints
1. Select a complex circuit from the inspiration and examples below: we've provided musical, artistic and goofy examples for you to riff on.  
2. Remove and/or replace two module bits from the circuit. 
3. Make a short video of you explaining what you changed and what the circuit does now that it didn't before. 

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

3. [Music Meets Physics with Beats](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/music-meets-physics-with-beats)

4. [Logic Rhythm](http://littlebits.cc/projects/logic-rhythm)

>Which product did you use and what made you decide to choose this?

>The Synth Kit has allowed us to get users to experiment with sound making in a very personal way. In the film  weâ€™ve just made (below), we were in a workshop for users to create creature sounds. The Synth Kit was ideal for this and gave us a way for users to not only create sounds but to use the kit to physically make their sounds and understand how the different modules worked together. The product is great because it helps you find weird organic sounds through experimentation.

## Share Your Invent 
Upload your project to littleBits [Maker Hub](http://littlebits.cc/projects) and post the link below. Make sure in your upload, you model a ["reflective design process"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) and include:
- The specific bits you used in the project
- Reflect on what did you do 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- List the resources you consulted to help others in the future

Next Steps:
1. Readings on Music Education / Music Creation
2. Group Activity
3. Re/hack: Hack this Module
