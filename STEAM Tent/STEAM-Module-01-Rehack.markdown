- Post your activity in Discourse below. 
- We've included a community activity you can pick up and use for your chapter or local group. 

## Community Activity: "Get Elegant + Remix Your Logic"
1. At your event, have everyone design and put together a complex logic circuit like the ones we outlined in the Module 1 Invent. 
2. Individually, ask participants to remove 2 bits in their circuits and still have the circuit function.
3. In pairs, ask participants to put their complex circuits together to design a creative sound or science project. What can they accomplish together (2 brains + 2 sets of bits) that is bigger than they could accomplish on their own?
