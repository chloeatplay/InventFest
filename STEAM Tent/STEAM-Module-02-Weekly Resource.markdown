# STEAM Module 2: How Do You Design Events Learners Will Love?

From [Alex Hillman's](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/02/how-to-design-community-building-events-that-people-will-love-and-remember/) blog

### Design Principles for Equity 
With any design project, I like to start with identifying certain design principles or priorities. When it comes to an event, I’d outline these as: 

- interaction and mixing 
- collaboration over competition 
- personal over professional 

That way we can look at each interaction we design and see if it meets those priorities. For an unconference (for Ordcamp in particular, since they are great), I’d recommend the following: 

1. Prompt Campers to co-create. As a Camper, you’re assigned 2-3 other folks at random the week before. Brainstorm 3 of your passions, share 1 of them, and come up with a session idea that taps on all your collective ideas. For instance, if you’re all good at multitasking, come up with a session on time, being present or slowing down. 

 2. Self-introductions. Our interests were written on our name tags when we arrived (which I greatly prefer to my job title). But instead of having those pre-printed for us, in the first plenary session, prompt folks to introduce themselves to their neighbors without mentioning what they do for a living. 

3. Select sessions at random. Have folks put their session ideas in a big, Inventables-branded molded drum and pull them out. Or have campers spin a wheel when they walk in and a session spot is one of the prized options. Or have them roll ridiculous dice. The idea here is to not separate “ideas of ladies” vs. “ideas of dudes.” It’s important that women are not reminded of their gender before they do something potentially cognitively stressful (Steele & Ambady, 2006). 

4. Use the building to create a shared sense of identity. The building itself is playful. What story could be written using the titles of the rooms (Adventures in Babysitting, Risky Business, High Fidelity) crossed with the titles of sessions (Flaming Nunchucks, Farming Chickens, Uncertainty etc) before the sessions officially start? Or, is there a mystery that could be revealed by visiting each room? Which leads us to… 

5. Keep people moving. Remember the new-kid-in-town-walk-into cafeteria feeling? You can find a way to stem that awkwardness and prompt mixing of folks by a.) having people self-select into themed tables (superheroes, rock clubs, etc) or b) having folks change tables intermittently (whiskey course, anyone?). Speedgeeking is another attempt at keeping people moving, so they have a sense that they “know” the room and belong there. 

6. Report back. Involve the whole room in this phase by rocking a human spectogram (e.g. I learned something new. I met 5 amazing people. I did something I’d never done before) and then asking for stories out of that group. Involve the entire culture in the reflection process as a way to welcome individual stories. 

Event design is both an art and a science. Most of the time, the easiest option doesn’t nurture interaction or growth. 

And that’s what we want–humans interacting with each other. As peers.
