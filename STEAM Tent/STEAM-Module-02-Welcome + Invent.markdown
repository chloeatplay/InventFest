# STEAM Module Week 2: Intergalactic Classroom Lesson
This week we will focus on storytelling, space exploration, and classroom activity design. You'll need some of the bits associated with the [littleBits Space Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/space-kit) which if you haven't seen before, check it out in action!

## Design Constraints
1. Peruse the experiments fellow STEAM educators have made using littleBits below. 
2. Design an experiment you could conduct using a littleBits sensor, with a student-written lab report at the end. 
3. Experiment should explore what our planet is made out of, gravity or reflection.
4. Write 3-5 prompts and playtest the experiment with your students. Post your lesson plan in the Discourse discussion below. 

## Inspiration, Examples and Support

### [How to Discover a Planet](http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/how-to-discover-a-planet)

>Over the past score of years, scientists have discovered hundreds of what are known as exoplanets—planets that orbit stars outside of our own solar system.   Different groups of scientists worldwide have used a variety of methods to detect these planets.  In this lesson we will investigate a method that has been quite fruitful in finding exoplanets as a result of the Kepler Mission, launched by NASA in 2009.  Another similar mission is CoRoT, led by the French Space Agency.  These missions identify exoplanets by a method called transit, in which the brightness of a star decreases when a planet passes directly between the star and the observer.  Many of us have observed a similar phenomenon on earth that occurs when the planets Mercury or Venus transit the Sun.

>In this lesson, you will simulate the transit of a planet over its star by placing the littleBits fan in front of a bright LED and use a light sensor to measure how the brightness of the light changes as the blades of the fan pass between the bright LED and the light sensor.  The fan blade corresponds to a planet and the bright LED to a star.  The fan spins rapidly, but that is no problem thanks to the littleBits Arduino module!  You will run a sketch (Arduino lingo for computer program) that automatically records the brightness changes as the fan blades “transit” the LED.  You then transfer the data to an Excel program that prepares a graph of brightness versus time for you to analyze.
