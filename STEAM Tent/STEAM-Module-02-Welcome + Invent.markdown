The culminating district-wide iSTEM Competition is held in late spring on a local college campus. For some students, it is the first time they have visited a college campus, and the visit brings a sense of awe in and of itself. At the same time as the elementary students are competing, middle and high school STEM Competition events are also happening around the campus.

In the elementary area, thirty (30) teams of four (4) students each are gathered in a very large room. In the center of each of the 30 tables is a container full of craft materials, a littleBits Kit, and a set of additional modules. The teacher advisors sit along the outside perimeter of the wall trusting that their students are well prepared for the challenge ahead. You can feel the combined excitement and energy of 120 students as they await the announcement of the theme and are given the go ahead to begin planning, designing and building.

Student teams are given 3 hours to design and build their creation based on the theme. Judges walk around and look for team work, collaboration and cooperation. Points are given for teamwork through the day as well as final project and presentation. All students on a team are expected to be able to answer questions about their project, and a final presentation is shared amongst the team. Points are even given for helping a neighboring team problem-solve. Finally each group presents their project to a team of judges. We include a “lights on” and “lights off” opportunity to each team during the judging. There is an additional 5 minutes allotted for the team to present and answer questions.
