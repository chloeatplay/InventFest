Time required: 2 hours

In this workshop, littleBits are used to teach children how to make their own interactive toys. A short demo about littleBits is presented in the beginning and includes ideas of fun projects to make. Participants construct different creatures -like tail-wagging animals and blinking robots - out of craft materials and littleBits. There are 8 templates available, but participants are encouraged to create their own designs.

What is learned: 
circuits, motion, light, design process
