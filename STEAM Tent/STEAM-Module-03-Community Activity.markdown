# STEAM Module 3 Community Activity: Make a Whole Darn Jungle Together

![](Images/jungleintro.png)

Time required: 2 hours

In this workshop, littleBits are used to teach children how to make their own interactive toys. A short demo about littleBits is presented in the beginning and includes ideas of fun projects to make. Participants construct different creatures -like tail-wagging animals and blinking robots - out of craft materials and littleBits. There are 8 templates available, but participants are encouraged to create their own designs.

Directions (more below):
- Design and draft an animal
- Learners should work together to draft a story of how their animals (or plants!) function together in a wider ecosystem
- Each animal should use at least one sensor
- Take a photo of the animals and a map of your ecosystem and post it to [MakerHub](http://littlebits.cc/projects)
