# STEAM Module 3 What on Earth is Bioluminesence?

>In the deep, dark ocean, many sea creatures make their own light for hunting, mating and self-defense. Bioluminescence expert Edith Widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world. At TED2011, she brings some of her glowing friends onstage, and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life.

# Questions: 

1. Why does light fascinate us? Consider our obsession with LEDs, neon signs, even litebrite. How can littleBits projects tap our obsession?
2. Widders tells us that, through tracking pollution, bioluminesence shows how our ecosystems are connected. What other examples could you use to illustrate how ecosystems are connected?
