# STEAM Module Week 3: "Design a Ecosystem"
Last week we asked you to tinker with littleBits in the name of creating a community of curiosity with your littleBits crew. This week we'll be digging into how to use your bits to explore the biological elements of the world around us. 

After you design your own pet, we're going to ask you to build an ecosystem with the other folks in your face-to-face crew or chapter. 

## Design Constraints
1. Your pet must use more than 2 sensors. 
2. It must respond to its environment in some way--to temperature or to touch.
3. Your pet need not already exist in the animal kingdom. In fact, it's better if it comes from your imagination.

>Based on original research in Michael Wilkinson's 4th Grade Science Classroom at Fieldston Lower School ECFS (http://www.ecfs.org, http://mwmathsci.blogspot.com)

>littleBits in the elementary science lab facilitates a STEAM process that enables students to easily design, build and engineer prototypes of lab apparatus that would otherwise be inaccessible. The following project is an illustration of how littleBits can be used to support serious scientific inquiry.

>Authentic scientific exploration often relies on engineering apparatus to facilitate obtaining the data that supports or contradicts a hypothesis.

>ENGINEERING CHALLENGE: How can littleBits be combined with other materials to build an apparatus and prove that the direction in which a seedling's roots grow is affected by gravity?

>OBJECTIVE: Students will engineer a littleBits lab apparatus to negate the effect of gravity on plant seedlings.

>PROJECT: The design shown here is our solution to this challenge. For full lesson instruction, see http://littlebits.cc/browse-lessons/seedspinner-simulating-microg-with-littlebits-and-fastplants

What is your favorite littleBits project?

When working in a grades 4 and 5 class, I watched two grade 5 students persist over three days to make their vision for a project come alive. The girls had this idea to make a small stuffed animal be able to move and dance. They drew up plans, performed surgery on a Miga (one of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics mascots) to remove the stuffing and used two DC motors as part of their littleBits circuit in Miga’s arms to make it dance. To top things off, they used a pulsing LED wire wrapped around a toilet paper roll to create a disco ball. Disco Miga was a hit and the girls pride was heartwarming.

The culminating district-wide iSTEM Competition is held in late spring on a local college campus. For some students, it is the first time they have visited a college campus, and the visit brings a sense of awe in and of itself. At the same time as the elementary students are competing, middle and high school STEM Competition events are also happening around the campus.

In the elementary area, thirty (30) teams of four (4) students each are gathered in a very large room. In the center of each of the 30 tables is a container full of craft materials, a littleBits Kit, and a set of additional modules. The teacher advisors sit along the outside perimeter of the wall trusting that their students are well prepared for the challenge ahead. You can feel the combined excitement and energy of 120 students as they await the announcement of the theme and are given the go ahead to begin planning, designing and building.

Student teams are given 3 hours to design and build their creation based on the theme. Judges walk around and look for team work, collaboration and cooperation. Points are given for teamwork through the day as well as final project and presentation. All students on a team are expected to be able to answer questions about their project, and a final presentation is shared amongst the team. Points are even given for helping a neighboring team problem-solve. Finally each group presents their project to a team of judges. We include a “lights on” and “lights off” opportunity to each team during the judging. There is an additional 5 minutes allotted for the team to present and answer questions.

### MWMathSci
4th & 5th Grade Math-Sci teacher and his students on a never-ending journey of STEAM exploration.

>The Challenge:  Design a MeasuringBot that can measure a linear distance.
The concept of the MeasuringBot is an integrated Math-Design-Engineering Challenge for 3rd Grade and up. Under 5th grade would not be expected to apply 2πr=C in their methodologies, but advanced 5th graders and higher would. In the following example, students would also test the effect of differently sized wheels on the measure linear distance. Based on this, they would be asked to predict how many 3 second motor impulses would be required to travel a specific distance. 

>These concepts apply directly to robotic planetary exploration such as the Mars Rovers. Since "rover drivers" can't see the rovers move, they must employ other indirect methods of knowing where the rover is. Motor rotation rates and wheel sizes are known quantities. Knowing how long the driver motors were engaged allows one to calculate the distance traveled and prevent driving into a hazard.

>In this prototype, a wheel with a radius of 2 cm was chosen. The pulse rate from the Cloud Module is 3 sec. yielding 1.5 revolutions. 1.5 • (2 • 3.14 • 2) = 6.28 cm of travel per pulse, or about 15.9 pulses per meter of travel.
