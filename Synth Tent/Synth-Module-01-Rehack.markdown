## Community Activity: Make Your Own Orchestra
Time required: 1- 2 hours

The Dark Circuits Festival workshop created a 20-piece Synth Kit orchestra which was conducted using flashcards and hand signals.

The event was run during MakeMusicNewYork, which is a live, free musical celebration held on June 21, the longest day of the year, with over 1,000 concerts on streets, sidewalks, and parks across the five boroughs. This year at The Firehouse, it merged with Hans Tammen's "Dark Circuits" Festival -- with a 20-piece orchestra of Korg littleBits synth players.

Using flashcards and hand signals, Hans Tammen has created large multi-movement pieces with large ensembles of electronic instruments for over a decade. As part of this year's MakeMusicNY he worked with an ensemble of Korg littleBits synthesizer players.
