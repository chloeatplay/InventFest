# Synth Module Week 2: Dance Party

## Your Weekly Invention: Invent Your Own Synth Boombox
So you've made an instrument, and joined forces with others to create a symphony. Now what? Time to take your sound skills to the next level and make a home-grown object that plays a song. This is an advanced module that is great for your face-to-face meetups: once you have the prototype up-and-running, you can add more complexity and flair. 

For this module, you're going to need bits from the [Synth Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/synth-kit), the [Arduino Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/arduino-coding-kit)and an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) microcontroller. 

## Design Constraints
1. Your synth boombox will feature a bass line + melody.
2. To make your box, "upcycle" something in your house, like a spare doorknob, mixing bowl, or a broom. 
3. Use a bit you haven't paid much attention to before. For this activity, [filters](http://littlebits.cc/bits/filter) and the [mix](http://littlebits.cc/bits/mix) bits will be useful. Be sure to include "how you got to know your bit" when you upload your project. 

## Inspiration, Examples and Support
1. Directions from littleBits and OK Go on how to use Synth + Arduino to create your own nifty song-maker. Arduino code and circuit sketches included to help you feel safe, comfy and creative.
