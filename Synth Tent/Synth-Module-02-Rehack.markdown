# Synth Module 2: Dance Party

## Core Questions

- If you could revise this the "Invented Boombox" for a group, what would that look like?
- Post your proposed activity in Discourse below. 
- We've included a community activity you can pick up and use for your chapter or local group. 

## Community Activity: Dance Party

1. After asking your local community to make their Boombox, bring them all together on an evening or weekend day to show off their instrument. 
2. Once everyone is settled (and booted up), gather all the participants in a circle. 
3. Each person will play their Invented Boombox for a minute or two, and prompt folks to jump in and groove to that particular tune. 
4. After 2 minutes, the next person will jump in with their boombox.
5. Take a video of the event and post it below.
