# Synth Module Week 3: Video Game Maestro

## Your Weekly Invention: Game Sound Design
We all remember the iconic music of Zelda, Sonic and Tetris (well, maybe some of us were more Pong folks). This module will show you the amazing creative freedom of sound design. 

This module will build upon what you'e learned so far from using the 
the [Synth Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/synth-kit) and the [Arduino Kit](http://littlebits.cc/kits/arduino-coding-kit). 

## Design Constraints
1. Your song will need to feature loops for "victory" and "defeat."
2. The sound should last at least 60 seconds. 
3. When you upload your project, say a bit about the game you envisioned accompanying this sound.  

## Inspiration, Examples and Support
### Directions from littleBits and OK Go on how to use Synth + Arduino to create your own nifty song-maker. 
Arduino code and circuit sketches included to help you feel safe, comfy and creative.

>A impro electronic-industrial track testing Korg's LittleBits. DB605 is a solo project by Andrea from My Right of Frost steampunk circuit bending industrial band.

> My Right of Frost draws sound signs from electronic circuits rewired and made unstable up to the feedback’s critical point. The sequences proposed are totally improvised from the point of view of the musical value of the sounds, and tonally unrepeatable. Across and beyond the concept of circuit bending, My Right of Frost operates constantly on the verge of oscillators and filter’s collapse, extemporizing electronic paths that diverge to form a macro-sign, i.e. the artwork.
