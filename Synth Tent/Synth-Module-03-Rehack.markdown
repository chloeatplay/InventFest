## Community Activity: Remix Game Music

1. Comb through the projects posted by your fellow BitStars in Module 3. 
2. With your face-to-face community, focus in on one tune that you'd like to remix / sample / riff on.
3. Each person in your face-to-face crew will make their own synth riffing on that sample, and present it back to the group after 1-2 hours.
4. In a studio-critique setting, what design choices did people make? How did they choose to change the sound? Which bits did they use that were different?
